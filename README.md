Done in partial fulfillment of MTMW14- Numerical Modelling of Atmosphere and Oceans (Project 1) at the University of Reading, Department of Meteorology.

A Recharge Oscillator Model (ROM) is given by Jin (1997b) for modelling Seas Surface Temperature (SST) and thermocline depth anamalies caused by the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the Pacific ocean along the equator.

# Implementation
Execute the code in file project1_final.ipynb to generate all plots and report.

Constants.py, ENSO.py, funcs.py and TimeSchemes.py need to be in the same folder but do not need to be executed.

Final report in pdf format is project1_final.pdf
